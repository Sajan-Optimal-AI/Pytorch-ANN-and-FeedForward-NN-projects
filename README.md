# PIMA diabets dataset - ANN project Using Pytorch ideas:

# 1.About the data:
            A.Data can be held from 'https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database'
            B.Datasets contains 9 features including labels of binary class
           
# 2.Step by Step Implementation:
           1.Data Import
           2.Pairplot Idea
           3.Data Split and tensor conversion
           4.Create ANN-Pytorch Model
           5.Training and Evaluation of ANN-Model
           6.Plotting the loss
           7.Prediction on X_test data and performance metrics
           8.Predictions on new data
